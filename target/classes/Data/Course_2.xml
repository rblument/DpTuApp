 Mastery learning is used to sequence the three top-level units in this course
 such that the student must complete the previous unit before moving on to the
 next unit (see the units for the pedagogical approach used in each unit).

<Course id="2" title="Dynamic Programming" primaryPedagogy="Fixed Sequence">
    <Description>
        Familiarizes students with the operation of the Dynamic Programming
        algorithm.

      The tasks in this See One unit are performed by the student in a fixed

        <Description>
            In this unit, the student will see an example of how each primary
            step of the Dynamic Programming algorithm is performed. It also exposes the
            student to the general operation of the DpTu application.

                  Welcome, I'm DpTu. I'll begin by showing you how this
                  application works by demonstrating how Dynamic Programming
                  works.\n\n
                  When I send you an information message, like this one, all you
                  have to do is acknowledge it by pressing the 'Acknowledged'
                  button.

                  Before I have you practice the operations associated with
                  a Dynamic Programming algorithm, I'm going to show you how these 
                  operations work. Along the way, we'll demonstrate some of the
                  actions you can perform in this application including how
                  you can interact with me. BTW, I'm a dumb AI, so don't expect
                  too much. Once again, this is an information message, so 
                  please move on by pressing the 'Acknowledged' button.
